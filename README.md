- 👋 Hi, I’m @sasasubotic
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity and cloud technology, specifically Azure but am open to any.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at Georgetown for my masters in MIS, and studying for Azure and CompTIA certs for cloud and cyber respectively.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really! I pick up on things relatively well.
